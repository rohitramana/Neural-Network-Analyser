# Neural Network Analyser

Neural Network analyzer produces detailed information about the estimated execution time, memory required, MACs and other metrics for a given networks. 

## These parameters will serve as inputs to your performance prediction tool
-External â€“ internal memory bandwidth in bytes / second (10 GB / second) Internal memory size in bytes (16 MB) 

-Matrix multiplication primitive size M, N, K in BLAS notation (32, 32, 32) Number of matrix multiplication primitives operating in     parallel (1) Number of matrix multiplication primitive completions per second (1e9 / 32) 

-Vector primitive size N x 1 (32) Number of vector primitives operating in parallel (1) Number of vector primitive completions per        second (1e9)

The .json files are generated using jsonGeneration.py from Tensorflow Keras Library.
Change the parameters from the "# Define" section at the beginning of analysis.py

Assumptions:
1. No compute considered for padding layers.
2. Memory location is 1 if the data is in internal memory and 0 if the data is in external memory.
